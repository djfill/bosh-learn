# BOSH-Learn

These instructions are a mixture of two tutorials - [Deploy BOSH on Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/bosh/README.md) and [A Guide to Using BOSH](http://mariash.github.io/learn-bosh/#create_release).

## The reason for combining the two guides:
1. I wanted my BOSH instance in the Cloud rather than hosted locally on Virtualbox
2. I wanted to test my BOSH instance with a simple application rather than an expensive Cloud Foundry deployment
3. The differences in BOSH v1 and v2 was confusing and meant that the manifest in one guide did not deploy on my cloud based BOSH instance.
